Welcome to TraSMAPy's documentation!
====================================

TraSMAPy is a high-level python API focused on both simplicities of usage by non-developers and feature completeness for the SUMO traffic simulator. The API is intended to be used by both software developers and engineers without an informatics background. Users only require minimal knowledge of the Python programming language to use the API, making it ideal for engineers of non-informatics-related fields.

The open-source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/joaoCostaIFG/trasmapy/>`_ and licensed under an MIT license.
