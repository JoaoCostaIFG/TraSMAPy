Installing TraSMAPy
===================

You can install TraSMAPy using the following command:

    pip install "git+https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/TraSMAPy.git"

This will install TraSMAPy and all its dependencies.

Optionally, you can create a virtual environment and install TraSMAPy inside it:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install "git+https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/TraSMAPy.git"

Don't forget to activate the virtual environment before using TraSMAPy, and to add the `venv` directory to your `.gitignore` file.
